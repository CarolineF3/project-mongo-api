# Mongo API Project

This week's assignment was to use Mongodb to store data, and to query that data from an API.

## The problem

I had some problems deploying the database, I finally realised it was due to the environmental variables and that I was only seeding the database when the environmental varible RESET_DB was set to "true".

Technologies: Mongo DB, Mongoose, API, Express, Javascript ES6, Node.js

Routes:
/books/<br>
/books/book/:bookID<br>
/books/isbn/:ISBN<br>
/books/topten
